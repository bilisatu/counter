# Counter

A simple browser counter that lets you increment, decrement, or reset a value with three buttons.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the buttons to update the value shown in the counter display.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – markup for the counter interface.
- `style.css` – styling for the counter layout and buttons.
- `script.js` – JavaScript logic that updates the displayed count.
